                <h2 id=aboutus class="centerhead">About Us</h2>
                <p>We are a mother-and-daughters team of Red Cross certified lifeguards and water safety instructors,
                    with more than three decades of competitive swimming experience between us. What we all enjoy most
                    about being good swimmers is the ability to enjoy a wide variety of water
                    activities, from pool swimming to ocean swimming, and especially bodysurfing.</p>
                <p>But you don't have to be an expert swimmer to enjoy the water! The most important thing is water
                    safety.</p>
                <p>We offer a safe space for people from all walks of life to enjoy the
                    wonderful world of aquatics.</p>
                <p>Our lessons are for people of any age or ability. We set up each lesson in consultation with you and
                    adapt the conditions to meet your needs.</p>
                <h3>Why we teach</h3>
                <p>I first had the idea to someday offer lessons in my own home many years ago, when a friend asked me
                    to teach her how to swim. Her religious beliefs made learning to swim in public problematic due to
                    the lack of privacy and proper swimming attire available. Today the burkini has been fairly well
                    adapted to water activities. Nevertheless, learning to swim in such attire is much more difficult.
                </p>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>There are any number of reasons thatLet swimming lessons offered in our local community can be (or
                    feel)
                    inaccessible to people: water temperature, scheduling conflicts, overstimulating environments, lack
                    of privacy, and so on.</p>
                <p>So while my daughters teach swimming as a side-job to their studies, I do it in my free time to make
                    swimming lessons more accessible to people in my community.</p>
