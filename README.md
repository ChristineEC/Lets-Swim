#Swim with Chrissy

### Description







###Features

####Header
The header contains an H1 with an anchor element linked to the home page, as well as a nav bar linked to the different pages of the website. Flex properties were used to make the nav bar wrap under the heading for smaller screen sizes. The nav bar was further styled to show horizontally, then stack when wrapped, and the list style was set to none. The pseudoclass a:hover was applied to the nav bar to indicate when the user hovers over the menu item.

The code for horizontally centering the logo (text) and the nav using line-height was taken from the Love Running Navigation Styling 2 video. Help with flex properties was obtained from [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).

For a reminder on how to style the nav list items horizontally, I referred to [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar_horizontal.asp).

For a reminder of how to include the a:hover pseudoclass, I referred to the Love Running video Navigation Styling 2.

####Main

The main section of the home page has a background image of sparkling water that covers the entire section.

####Footer
The footer includes the name of the business, city and country location (as the business is home-based--more detailed location to be included on the contact page), contact details, and two hyperlinked social media icons that open in new table, with alt text inviting the user to visit the business on Facebook and Instagram, respectively. The footer has been made responsive using flex properties, and the height is set to auto to enhance responsiveness.
